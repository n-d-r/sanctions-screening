This is a little tool I am building to screen individuals, entities, vessels, and/or aircraft against two sanctions lists provided by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control:

- the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons Lists ("SDN List")
- the Consolidated Sanctions List

For more information on those two lists, see here:
